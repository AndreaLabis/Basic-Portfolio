            Born in South Bend, Indiana across from the University of Notre Dame campus and the famous mural, <i>Touchdown Jesus</i>, I only stayed in Indiana for a few short years before my Dad decided to relocate the family to
             sunny Orlando, FL. The relocation happened was I was only 3 yrears old so the Floridian Lifestyle is all I have really ever known. Growing up, my parents would often take us to a different city in the state almost every 
             weekend so I am well traveled, at least when it comes to Florida! This travelling sparked an internal interest to continue to travel as an adult and ultimately, is a large part of the reason I decided to swtich up my career 
             after dedicating myself for a total of 17 years to one field!!
        <br>

             Up until I decided to get my Web Developer certification, my career was dominated working for manufacturing companies where I held positions in Accounts Receivable, Logistics Route Planning, and Material Planning/Buying. 
             My greatest achievement thus far has been maintaining a challenging 14 year career working for Tempur Sealy, Int.  Throughout my time as a Material Planner and Route Planner, I developed a better understanding of computer programs and
             how they work, which helped peak my interest in Web Development. After doing some research and starting to learn code in my free time, I came across an advertisement one day for the University of Central Florida's Coding Boot Camp and 
             instantly knew I wanted the challenge and career change...so, I applied!  Thankfully, I was accepted and now, my life has forever changed.  
        <br>
             My dream now centers around a career with the freedom to work from home or from the beach if I choose!  I also love art and designing and can't wait to start deveolping 
             websites for new sites and businesses around the globe!!
